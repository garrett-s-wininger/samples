# Python Interoperability

This section of the repo covers interfacing Python with C/C++ code and vice-versa, 
enabling each language to use functionality that is defined in the other. Methods 
of interfacing range between native libraries and integrations to 3rd party libraries 
that take advantage of the heavy lifting.
