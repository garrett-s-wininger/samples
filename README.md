# Code Samples

This repository is meant to be a scratch space for code snippets across a number of technology stacks and operating systems. Given the different development and runtime environments that may be in any given sample, README's will be provided for instruction on how to run and develop the sample at any given point in the repo.

## Warning

As a set of samples, the code here is meant to demonstrate getting a particular technology, or portion of said technology, to work. Unless called out otherwise, the only guarantee is that the code will run. There is no guarantee on performance or proper engineering abstractions, except where these are the focus of the code.
